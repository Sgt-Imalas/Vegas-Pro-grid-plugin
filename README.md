# Vegas-Pro-grid-plugin
This is a small script I wrote to create video grids in Sony vegas.

to create the grid, first select all videos you want to have in the grid, then run the script

in the scrip window there is the option to reset all video adjustments (to get rid of bad configs; this is automatically done before creating a new grid layout)

you can enter how many columns and rows your grid should have.
also you can select the start position of the first video in your grid via startX and startY.
